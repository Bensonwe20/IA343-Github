GPT-5 merges advanced reasoning with multimodal capabilities—representing a significant leap over GPT‑4 and its variants ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-5?utm_source=openai)).\n",

       "In **August 2025**, Google DeepMind released **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**, widely known as **“Nano Banana”**—a text-to-image generation tool integrated into the Gemini app and Vertex AI. Renowned for its photorealistic “3D figurine” imagery, it enables dynamic editing and context-aware modifications via natural language, and features SynthID watermarking for content traceability. The release contributed to more than 200 million image edits and over 10 million first-time Gemini app users in the weeks following launch ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_Banana?utm_source=openai)).\n",

An even more powerful model, **Llama 4 Behemoth**, was previewed, affirming Meta’s aggressive AI infrastructure expansion, with plans of up to $65 billion in investments to date ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-releases-new-ai-model-llama-4-2025-04-05/?utm_source=openai)).\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Diversity**: Bacteria are incredibly diverse, with millions of species that vary in shape, size, and habitat.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Ubiquity**: They are found everywhere on Earth, from the deepest oceans to the arid deserts and even inside our bodies.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Size**: Typically, bacteria are about 0.5 to 5.0 micrometers in size, which is much smaller than most eukaryotic cells.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Shapes**: Common shapes of bacteria include rods (bacilli), spheres (cocci), spirals (spirilla), and commas (vibrios).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Reproduction**: Bacteria primarily reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Genetic Exchange**: They can exchange genetic material through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction, contributing to genetic diversity.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Beneficial Roles**: Many bacteria are beneficial; for example, they play a crucial role in digestion, nutrient cycling, and biodegradation.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Pathogenicity**: Some bacteria can cause diseases in humans, animals, and plants, such as tuberculosis, strep throat, and bacterial meningitis.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Antibiotics**: Bacterial infections are often treated with antibiotics, but overuse has led to antibiotic resistance, a significant public health concern.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Extremophiles**: Certain bacteria, known as extremophiles, can thrive in extreme conditions, such as hot springs, acidic environments, and radioactive waste.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **Biofilms**: Bacteria can form biofilms, complex communities attached to surfaces, which can be more resistant to antibiotics.\n",
       "\n",
       "12. **Role in Food**: Bacteria are used in food production, such as in the fermentation process to produce yogurt, cheese, and vinegar.\n",
       "\n",
       "Understanding bacteria is crucial for fields such as medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology."
